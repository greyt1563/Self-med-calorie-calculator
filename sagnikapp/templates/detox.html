			<h4>Yoga Detox – Try these easy yoga poses to detoxify your body!
</h4>
            <p class="line">The right yoga routine can also help you detox your body and mind. Through daily yoga, we can help our bodies eliminate unwanted impurities such as carbon dioxide, lactic acid, and lymphatic fluid, and allow blood to flow to the organs.</p>
			<p class="line">Generally any yoga routine with many inversions, forward bends and twists will be the most beneficial to your daily detoxing practice.</p>
			<p class="line">Don’t have a fixed routine? Now is the perfect time to start! Do these easy yoga poses any time you feel like you need a little mini detox. These positions will improve your digestion, boost your strength and flexibility, while making you feel brand shiny new.</p>
			<p class="line"><b>Tip:</b> As you go through the yoga detox moves, use each inhale to lengthen and each exhale to rid yourself of anything you no longer want or need.</p>

			<h4>1. Downward Facing Dog:</h4>
			<p class="line">Downward Dog is an example of an inversion movement. Your heart is above your head.  Inversions encourage blood to circulate in a different direction and rinse out lymph nodes.</p>
			<p class="line">1.From table position, tuck the toes under, press into the hands and begin to lift the hips up towards the ceiling.<br>	
			2.Spread the fingers wide apart with the middle finger facing forward, and the palms shoulder-width apart. Press out through the fingers and edges of the hands<br>
			3.Press the hips up and back, reaching the chest towards the thighs. Lift up through the tailbone to keep the spine straight and long.<br>
			4.Have the feet a hip’s width apart with the toes facing forward. Press the heels into the floor feeling a deep stretch in the back of the legs. Your legs are straight, but you can have a small bend at the knees to keep the back flat.<br>
			5.Let the head and neck hang freely from the shoulders or look up at the belly button.<br>
			6.Breathe and hold for 4-8 breaths.<br>
			7.To release: bend the knees and lower the hips back to Table position, or come all the way down to child pose.</p>

			<p class="line">2.Lift your left leg in the air like we did above for the downward dog pose and take a couple of deep breaths. </p>

			<h4>3. Eagle Pose</h4>
			<p class="line"> The eagle pose helps to boost circulation and wring out the toxins from the bloodstream and lymphatics. It also stretches the ankle, elbow, knee and hip joints.</p>
			<p class="line"> 1.Start by standing straight with your legs drawn close together and arms by your side.<br>
			 2.Draw your right foot upward, pressing against the left leg. Wrap the right foot on the left leg just above the ankle and bend both your knees so that the inside of your right thigh rests on the left thigh.<br>
			 3.Lean forward and cross the right arm over the left arm, with elbows interlocked. Keep your hands together as if you were clapping and breathe in. Retain the pose for as long as you inhale then breathe out.<br>
			 4.Revert to the standing position with legs together and redo the pose, this time with the left foot wrapped around the right leg and the left arm rolled onto the right arm.</p>

			<h4>4. Seated Twist</h4>
			<p class="line">It’s common to equate twisting postures with detoxing. Any sort of compression and gentle movement in the torso definitely helps to get things moving in the digestive system. The more we help our digestive system move waste and toxins through the intestines, the better our detoxing. </p>
			<p class="line">1.Sit flat on your bottom with your tush behind you to ensure a long spine. <br>
			2.Keeping the feet together, lengthen up through the top of your head.<br>
			3.Take your right hand to the mat behind you, either on fingertips or with a flat palm, and hug your knees or hook your elbow to the outside of your right knee, as you twist your chest open to the right.<br>
			4.Make sure both glutes stay grounded. The twist should happen in the upper part of your torso and not the sacrum. <br>
			5.Hold this position for at least 5 breaths, lengthening up as you inhale, and deepening the twist on the exhale. </p>

			<h4>5. Wide Leg Forward Fold</h4>
			<p class="line">The wide-legged forward bend helps to boost circulation as it positions the head below the heart. The pose also helps facilitate digestion. </p>
			<p class="line">1.Step your feet about one leg-length apart! The outer edges of your feet should be parallel to the edge of your mat. <br>
			2.Put your hands on your hips and as you inhale, and reach skywards with the crown of your head.<br>
			3.On the exhale, keep the back long and strong as you fold forward, either keep the hands on the hips, place them under your shoulders on the mat, or on blocks. <br>
			4.Stay here, or begin to walk the hands back so that the fingertips line up with the toes and bend your elbows, stacking them over your wrists.<br>
			5.Relax and release the entire back body while keeping the kneecaps lifting to stabilize your foundation. <br>
			6.Stay for 5 breaths, then take your hands back to your hips to come up out of the pose with a long spine. </p>

			<h4>6. Boat Pose</h4>

			 2.Once you achieve this position, stretch your legs outward.<br>
			3.Pull your upper body to touch your feet. Keep trying until you achieve the boat pose. <br>

			<h4>7. Bound Headstand</h4>
			<p class="line">The Bound Headstand removes toxins in the circulatory and lymphatic systems. This pose is typically held for 7 breaths or longer, and focusing on deep breaths clears out carbon dioxide from the lungs. </p>
			<p class="line"><b>Tip:</b> If you’re new to this pose, use a wall to help you with your balance and prevent falling backward. </p>
			<p class="line">1.From a tabletop position, clasp your fingers creating a nest for the top of your head on the floor and place your head in the clasp.<br>
			2.Straighten your legs and walk your feet in towards your head. When your body weight is removed from your legs, bend your knees and start to take your legs off the floor using your abdominals.<br>
			3.Take your legs up straight, maintaining control from the top of your head through your core, and out through the toes. <br>
			4.Hold this pose for 7-10 deep breaths, slowly bending your knees and coming down in the same controlled way you went up.</p>
