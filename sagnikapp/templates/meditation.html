			<h3>Your body and mind on morning meditation</h3>
            <p class="line">Meditation is a great tool to maintain a healthy balance of dialogue between your mind and your body. It is a simple technique that you can practice anytime and anywhere to alleviate stress. Just like physical exercise, the more you practice, the more benefits you’ll notice and the longer they will last – in both, mind and body.</p>
			<p class="line">Here’s the thing: you can focus on eating healthier, exercising more frequently, getting more sleep, using more natural products on our skin and at home, but <b>if you don’t take care of your mind, you will still feel unbalanced in your life.</b>.</p>
			<p class="line">Meditation makes you have a cleaner body and clearer mind</p>

			<h4>Basic morning meditation techniques</h4>
            <p class="line">Every good meditation practice begins with finding what works best for you. Remember, there is no right or wrong way to meditate since there are different techniques or styles of meditation.</p>
			<p class="line">Here are a few of them:</p>
			<p class="line"><b>1.Breathing meditation –</b> You can use this technique alone as a meditation to calm your mind and reduce distractions. Simply focus your attention on your breath, the inhale and exhale.</p>	
			<p class="line"><b>2.Candle staring –</b> This is great if you find it hard focusing. Just light a candle and stare at it. Your attention will be held. If your mind has thoughts, just thank them and go back to staring at the candle.</p>
			<p class="line"><b>3.Mantra meditation –</b> Repeating words can help you find calm and focus. We can feel deep inner peace.</p>
			<p class="line"><b>Guided meditation –</b> There are many resources online that have guided meditations and music to help you relax. Just google “guided meditation” and you’ll find tons of resources.</p>
			<p class="line"><b>Walking meditation – </b>We cover that one above — a 10 minute walking meditation involving 1 minute of paying attention to each of the feelings of your body while walking, the feeling of your breath, the sensations of air or wind on your skin, what you can hear, and what you can see.</p>
			<p class="line"><b>Mindfulness meditation</b> – Mindfulness is about recognizing what is happening in the present moment, including what is arising and passing. This includes thoughts, sounds, feelings in the body and anything else present. The idea is to just observe without judgment, and remain open and aware.</p>

			<h4>1. Sit upright comfortably</h4>

            <p class="line"> If you’re like me and you try to meditate while lying down, you’ll fall asleep. Instead, sit in a comfortable chair with an upright back, get a meditation cushion, or fold a pillow and sit cross-legged on it, which will help support your back.</p>

			<h4>2. Breathe deeply</h4>
            <p class="line">Ah, the breath, the wonderful breath. It’s our ANCHOR to the present moment and a tool available at all times. Start by taking 10 deep breaths and counting to five during each exhale and inhale.</p>
			<p class="line">Allow your lungs to fill up as you inhale (it feels good to take a deep inhale) and then slowly exhale through your nose, allowing your shoulders to drop. Repeat.</p>

			<h4>3. Gently close your eyes</h4>
            <p class="line"> If you’re not doing so already, I suggest closing your eyes to help you focus. It’s easy to give our mind an excuse to wander when we are staring at our laundry that needs to be done.</p>

</h4>
            <p class="line"> I love this step because it’s checking in with our body. How many times a day do we ask others, “How are you?” A lot. How many times a day do we ask our body, “How are you?” Hardly ever.</p>
			<p class="line">It’s an opportunity to check in with your body which is an effective way to bring you into the present moment. Start by focusing on your feet and moving up to the top of your head.</p>
			<p class="line"> Notice if there is tension anywhere, and if there is, consciously send breath in the direction of that body part.</p>

            <p class="line"> When your mind wanders, which it will, come home to your breath. Your breath is the the number one tool to help you stay grounded, connected and focused in the moment. When you focus on your breathing, your heart rate slows down, your mind begins to quiet and your body can relax.</p>

			<h4>7. Gently open your eyes when you are ready</h4>
            <p class="line">I suggest practicing meditation for 5-10 minutes in the beginning. The best time of day to do it is in the morning—BEFORE having coffee, if you’re a caffeine consumer. </p>
			<p class="line">Connecting to your breath will set the tone for your day. It’s a positive and empowering tool to practice beyond the pillow, and throughout the day.</p>
			<p class="line">Even if you don’t have an opportunity to close your eyes, you can practice conscious breathing during a meeting, in a traffic jam or in a conversation. Find your inner peace with one of these wonderful meditation breaks.</p>
