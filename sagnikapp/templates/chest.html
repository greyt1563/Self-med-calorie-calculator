			<h4>1. Push-up: 3–6 sets of 6–12 reps</h4>
            <p class="line">The push-up is one of the most efficient bodyweight exercises you can do to build strength in your chest and triceps. But it also gives your shoulders, core muscles, lower back, and lower body a workout.</p>
			<p class="line"><b>How-to:</b> Lie facedown and place hands on the floor, slightly wider than shoulders. Push up to lift shoulders, torso, and legs until arms are fully extended. Only your hands and toes should be touching the floor. Slowly lower your body until chest almost touches the floor, then repeat.</p>
			<p class="line"><b>Pro tip:</b> Push-up variations are nearly endless. If you’re a beginner, you can start with wall push-ups or knee push-ups. Feeling advanced? Give pike push-ups a try.</p>

			<h4>2. Burpee: 6 per minute for 15 minutes</h4>

            <p class="line"> Need a more explosive exercise? The burpee may be the ultimate bodyweight exercise mash-up, working your chest, core, arms, back, glutes, and legs for a full-body cardio workout.</p>
			<p class="line"><b>How-to:</b> From a standing position, lower yourself into a squat and put both hands on the floor, just wider than your feet. Jump feet back into a plank position. Do a push-up, returning to the plank position. Draw your legs back up into a squat, then jump up explosively with your hands above your head. Repeat.</p>

			<h4>3. Pull-up: 3 sets of 2–5 reps</h4>
            <p class="line"> The pull-up can be intimidating, especially when you’re just starting out. But it’s a great bodyweight exercise to work your shoulders, upper back, and biceps. Start with just a few reps and work your way up as you get stronger.</p>
			<p class="line"><b>How-to: </b>Grab the pull-up bar with an overhand grip, wrapping your thumbs around the bar. “Play dead” — start in a dead hang from the bar. Squeeze the bar with your hands and engage the muscles of your upper body and core. Pull up until chin clears the bar. Slowly lower yourself back into the dead-hang position. Repeat.</p>
			<p class="line"><b>Pro tip:</b> For pull-ups at home, you can buy a portable pull-up bar that fits in a doorframe.</p>

<div class="container ">
    <p  class="line">If you prefer to start with weights or you’re ready to step up your workouts, you don’t need giant gym equipment. Just a set of dumbbells will do it. But you can also switch things up with kettlebells or resistance bands.</p>

			<h4>1. Chest press: 3–6 sets of 4–8 reps</h4>
            <p class="line"> The chest press targets your chest, shoulders, and triceps — primarily your pectorals and deltoids. In a gym, you’re likely to see people doing chest presses with a barbell, but you can easily do them at home with dumbbells too.</p>
			<p class="line"><b>How-to:</b> Lie faceup on a bench or the floor with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Hold the dumbbells at the sides of your chest, brace your core, and press the dumbbells straight up. Then lower the dumbbells nice and slow before repeating.</p>

			<h4>2. Lying dumbbell fly: 3–6 sets of 4–8 reps</h4>
            <p class="line"> Your chest strength will soar doing dumbbell flyes, which can be done on a bench or lying on the floor. You’ll hit your pectorals, deltoids, and biceps with this move.</p>
			<p class="line"><b>How-to:</b> Lie on a bench or the floor with your knees bent. Hold the dumbbells directly above your chest, with palms of hands facing each other. Lower the dumbbells in a slow arc to your sides, bending elbows as far as feels comfortable (or until they touch the floor, if you’re not using a bench). Keeping elbows bent, raise the dumbbells back above your chest again, then repeat.</p>

			<h4>3. Pullover: 3 sets of 10–12 reps</h4>
            <p class="line"> Build up your lats, pecs, and abs like a lumberjack chopping wood (without worrying about an ax or your aim). This dumbbell exercise can be done on a bench, the floor, or a stability ball. Just be sure to keep a good grip on the dumbbell!</p>
			<p class="line"><b>How-to:</b> Lie faceup with feet on the floor. Hold a single dumbbell in both hands and raise it above your chest. Slowly extend the dumbbell overhead while slightly bending your elbows, then bring it back to the starting position. Be sure to start this one with a low enough weight that you can manage it comfortably. Don’t risk dropping the dumbbell on your chest or head!</p>
