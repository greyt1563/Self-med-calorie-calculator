            </h4>
            <p class="line">Got a staircase? Or a box? Then you can do this leg workout. Step-ups are a simple beginner
                exercise that can give you stronger quads, glutes, and hamstrings. Just take one step at a time.</p>
            <p class="line"><b>How-to:</b> Go to the stairs in your home or, if you don’t have a staircase, place a
                sturdy box in front of you. Step up onto the box or the first stair with your right foot, then your
                left. Reverse, stepping back down with right foot, then left. Repeat, switching the leg you start with
                each time.</p>
            <p class="line"><b>Pro tip:</b> For added difficulty, raise your knee toward your chest when you take the
                second step onto the box or stair.

            <h4>2. Lunge: 3 sets of 15 reps (each side)</h4>

            <p class="line"> There are dozens of lunge variations you can do, but even just a classic lunge builds up
                your quads and glutes. Plus, it strengthens your hamstrings.</p>
            <p class="line"><b>How-to:</b> From a standing position, take a big step forward with one leg. Lower your
                body toward the floor until upper thigh of front leg is nearly parallel to the floor and back knee is
                just above the floor. Raise up by putting pressure on the heel of your front leg. Repeat by taking that
                big first step with the opposite leg.</p>

            <h4>3. Squat: 3–5 sets of 8–12 reps</h4>
            <p class="line"> Squats are popular with weightlifters, which can lead to the misperception that they can be
                done only with weights. But even squatting with your bodyweight alone can give you strong leg muscles if
                you do it with good form.</p>
            <p class="line"><b>How-to: </b> Stand with feet slightly wider than shoulder width. Extend arms straight
                with palms facing down. Inhale and push hips back slightly as you bend your knees. Look straight ahead
                and keep chin up, shoulders upright, and back straight. Squat as low as you comfortably can, aiming to
                have your hips sink below your knees. Engage your core to push upward explosively from your heels.</p>

    <p class="line">If you prefer to start with weights or you’re ready to step up your workouts, you don’t need giant

            <h4>1. Dumbbell squat: 3 sets of 12–15 reps</h4>
            <p class="line"> Squats alone work your major leg muscles, but adding weight can really help those muscles
                pop. You can also add dumbbells to any squat variation if you need a challenge.</p>
            <p class="line"><b>How-to:</b> Stand with feet hip-width apart, holding a dumbbell at each of your
                shoulders. Sit down into a low seated position, keeping weight in your heels. Pressing through heels,
                push hips forward and up to return to a standing position.</p>

            <p class="line"> Dumbbells add an extra degree of difficulty to lunges, and so does switching it up with a
                lunge variation. Adding dumbbells to walking lunges helps you build up your quads and glutes like your
                standard lunge and also works your grip strength.</p>
            <p class="line"><b>How-to:</b> Stand, holding a dumbbell in each hand. Lunge forward with your right leg,
                lowering until your knee is at a 90-degree angle. Push through your front foot to stand. Repeat by
                lunging with the other leg.</p>
